# Housing_prices_dataset

# Project Description:
This project predicts the selling prices of houses based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and more. 
It uses data preprocessing techniques (outlier handling, feature transformation), and machine learning models to achieve a good accuracy.
Dataset: Housing.csv
Features: price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, etc.
Target Variable: price

# Steps / Workflow:
1. Data loading & exploration
2. Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates removal)
3. Outlier detection and handling (Capping, Log Transformation)
4. Feature engineering (log transformations, categorical encoding)
5. Train-test split
6. Model training (Linear Regression, etc.)
7. Model evaluation (R² Score, RMSE)
   
# Model Performance:
Final Model:
R² Score: 0.649
RMSE: 1,331,071
Mean Price: 4,766,729
